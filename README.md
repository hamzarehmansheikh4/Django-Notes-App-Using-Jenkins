I successfully deployed a Django application on AWS using a Jenkins declarative pipeline to automate the CI/CD process. The pipeline orchestrates the build, test, and deployment stages, ensuring that code changes are seamlessly integrated and deployed to AWS. Leveraging AWS services like EC2 for hosting. This setup enhances the development workflow by enabling continuous integration and deployment, reducing manual intervention and speeding up delivery times. The result is a reliable, scalable Django application with automated deployments, ensuring high performance and availability.
